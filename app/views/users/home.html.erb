  <p class="blurb">My dream is to live in a world where everything is a single-page app. I promote this vision by building apps in Rails and Sinatra using Ruby and Javascript. I am currently learning Node as a way of trying to satisfy my hunger for more Javascript. In my spare time you will find me curling or hiking with my beagle Nibbler.</p>
